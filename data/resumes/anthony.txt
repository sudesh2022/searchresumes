Anthony normally play at Mandai golf course which is a public course of only nine holds and there is no need for a buggy as one can easily walk around the course comfortably.

Favourite Food 

Anthony has been a food person and enjoys all kinds of cuisine. Growing up in Australia, especially in Sydney, you get exposed to all the cuisines that the migrants of Australia have brought to the country. In Sydney, we have excellent Middle Eastern food from Lebanon and Turkey. We have good Italian, Greek and Spanish food. In terms of Anthonys' culinary preferences, Anthony always prefer to eat Vietnamese food, especially his mum’s cooking. Anthony has always believed and maintained that Vietnamese food is the best cuisine in the world because the Vietnamese have been able to evolve its food which has incorporated influences from South China, France, Thailand and Cambodia along with its innovation. The flavors of Vietnamese food are very balanced in flavors and in the south of Vietnam often a sweeter flavour. Vietnamese use a lot of fresh herbs and vegetables but do not overprocess our food by frying it. Vietnamese also like to wrap or roll our food in rice paper which is stuffed with meat, seafood, rice vermicelli, and herbs then dipping it into a dipping sauce.

Favorite Holiday Destination 
Anthonsy favourite destination is the Greek islands specifically Santorini. Santorini is one of the Cyclades islands in the Aegean Sea. Santorini was devastated by a volcanic eruption in the 16th century BC, forever shaping its rugged landscape. The rare natural beauty of Santorini is the breath-taking caldera, the views, the extraordinary volcanic beaches and the lunar landscapes are the wondrous results of this eruption that can only be admired in Santorini
